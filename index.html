    <h2>5 Tips on how to spend your <b>Erasmus</b> time in Brighton!</h2>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h3>1)  Wander around</h3>
    <p>The best thing to do (after you find an accommodation) is to wander around. Go to check out the beach, enjoy the narrow streets of North Lane and don’t forget to explore your neighbourhood. You never know where you might find a secret spot to relax of beautiful view over the city.<br>

    <br><b>Secret tip:</b> Go to see the cemetery close to Elm Grove street! It is such a good place to escape from everyday routine and get some peace into your soul. Plus it is really beautiful there (not in morbid way! haha).</p>

    <h3>2)	Getting new (ehm used but free!) stuff</h3>
    <p>During your wanders around the city you might notice that many locals leave nice things in front of their houses. Believe me they just want to get rid of them so you may take it (obviously use your common sense). Getting things for free is truly easy in Brighton! Another way is to check if the student union, some society or community doesn’t organise free stuff for newbies in the uni and city. This way I got half of my closet. Third way how to get freebies is online. Try Facebook Market place or Gumtree. Slightly more expensive way (haha everything is more expensive when you compare it to free stuff) are charity shops. They are absolutely great!<br>
    <br><b>Secret tip:</b> Are you looking for cutlery? Search no more. Visit student cafeteria and borrow theirs! At the end of your stay, don’t forget to return it!</p>

    <h3>3)	Don’t get fat, bet on triathlon!</h3>
  <p>There are many ways how to keep fin in Brighton! My favourite is the triathlon style.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cycle!</b><br>
    The best decision I made here was that I bought a bike. Ehm 15 pound bike - see point 2 above. I love it because it saves my money, keeps me fit and independent from (overcrowded) public transport.
    <br><br>
    <b>Swim!</b><br>
    If you are brave enough make the most out of living close to the sea! If you are more spoiled type there are various places where you can swim in nice warm water. Did you know that university students can swim in the city’s swimming pools only for a pound?!
    <br><br>
    <b>Run!</b><br>
    On every Saturday fans of running gather for joined 5k run in various parks across city! You have to be early bird for that, it starts at 9, but I am sure you will appreciate your efforts afterwards.</p>

    <h3>4)	Volunteer</h3>
    <p>If British society is good at one thing then volunteering would be it. The tradition to help the other without wanting to be payed is rooted deeply enough to have an opportunity to volunteer almost in every sector. There are plenty great initiatives which make our planet truly a better place. My favourites are Fare Share and the Real Jung Food Project. Don’t forget that people involved in NGOs have very often a good heart and thus make good friends!</p>

    <h3>5)	If you don’t know what to do check <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk">Eventbrite website</a></h3>
    <p>On Eventbrite you can find almost every event which is happening around. If you feel lonely at first and don’t know what to do give it a go and pick some event there. It is also worth it to check Facebook Events and see what is happening there.<br>
    <br><b>Tip:</b> Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts is a cool place with great events!</p>
